How to compile and run:
- open cmd or terminal
- change directory to where Project2.py is saved
- make sure that the directory where Project2.py also has 'network.txt;
- 'network.txt' should contain graph adjacency matrix
- run:
	$ py Project2.py

How to test for input files other than 'network.txt':
- You can either change the name of the file you want to 'network.txt'
OR
- You can open Project2.py with text editor of your choice
- Change 'network.txt' in line 129 of Project2.py to filename of choice
